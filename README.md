### Project Description
Travel Buddy is a platform that helps users find travel companions based on shared interests and destinations. By providing travel details like dates, destination, and preferences, users can easily connect with others who are traveling to the same place during the same time.

### The Problem statement
Traveling solo can be lonely, expensive, and sometimes a little intimidating. Finding someone who shares your interests and travel plans shouldn‚Äôt be a challenge. That's where Travel Buddy steps in ‚Äì matching like-minded travelers looking for company.

### The Solution
With Travel Buddy, finding a travel buddy is as easy as sharing your destination and interest! By inputting travel dates, destination, and interests, the platform will show you potential travel companions who are going to the same places and share the same passion for travel. No more lonely trips!

### Project Documentation
For Software:

Frontend

The frontend of this project uses HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), and JavaScript. The layout is designed for a clean and responsive user experience.
The index.html serves as the homepage where users input their travel details, while buddies.html displays the list of potential travel buddies.

Backend

Flask handles the server-side logic, routing, and user authentication. Firebase is used to store user data, including travel details, and manage user authentication via Firebase Auth.
The application logic checks for matching travel buddies by comparing users' destination, interests, and travel dates in the Firebase database.

User Authentication

Firebase Authentication is used to securely manage user sign-ups, logins, and sessions.
Database

Firebase Firestore is used to store user data. Each user document contains details like name, email, destination, interest, and travel_dates.

FUTURE SCOPE:

### **1. AI-Powered Trip Planner (Core Feature)**

This feature is the backbone of your platform, combining safety and planning for solo travelers.

- **Why focus on it?** It showcases the platform's core purpose: empowering users with safe, well-planned trips tailored to their preferences.
- **What to implement?**
    - A simple form where users can input preferences (destination, travel style).
    - Use the **Google Maps API** to:
        - Suggest safe routes.
        - Highlight safety zones on maps.
    - Display the itinerary (e.g., stops, attractions) dynamically in the UI.
- **Execution Time:**
    - **Backend:** 2‚Äì3 hours (Flask route + API integration).
    - **Frontend:** 2‚Äì3 hours (HTML, CSS, JavaScript to display results).

### **2.Regional Slang Translation & Cultural Guidance**
