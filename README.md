### Project Description
Travel Buddy is a platform that helps users find travel companions based on shared interests and destinations. By providing travel details like dates, destination, and preferences, users can easily connect with others who are traveling to the same place during the same time.

### The Problem statement
Traveling solo can be lonely, expensive, and sometimes a little intimidating. Finding someone who shares your interests and travel plans shouldn‚Äôt be a challenge. That's where Travel Buddy steps in ‚Äì matching like-minded travelers looking for company.

### The Solution
With Travel Buddy, finding a travel buddy is as easy as sharing your destination and interest! By inputting travel dates, destination, and interests, the platform will show you potential travel companions who are going to the same places and share the same passion for travel. No more lonely trips!
